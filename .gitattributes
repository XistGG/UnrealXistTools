# Make sure Windows batch files preserve CR/LF line endings, otherwise they may not be able to execute.  Windows
# batch files require a CR/LF for labels to work properly, otherwise they may fail when labels straddle 512-byte
# block boundaries.  This is important when files are downloaded through a zip archive that was authored on a
# Linux machine (the default behavior on GitHub)
*.bat eol=crlf
*.sh eol=lf

# Mac/Linux require LF line endings for hashbangs to work. Windows doesn't care about ps1 line endings.
